## 🎯 How You Can Contribute

- **Data Improvements**: Add or refine the message dataset, improve preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning, feature-engineering).  
- **Model Enhancements**: Experiment with various algorithms (ML, deep learning), fine-tune hyperparameters, improve accuracy and generalization.  
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Create better plots, confusion matrices, dashboards, or reports summarising model performance.  
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Improve the README, write step-by-step guides, annotate notebook code, add usage examples.  
- **Testing & Reproducibility**: Ensure pipelines run end-to-end, include example inputs/outputs, create unit tests or reproducible notebooks.
